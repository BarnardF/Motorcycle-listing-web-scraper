## Logging

The tracker creates detailed logs in `tracker.log`:

```
2024-11-01 14:23:15 - INFO - Loaded 5 bike model(s) from bikes.txt
2024-11-01 14:23:16 - INFO - [AutoTrader] Searching: Honda Rebel 500
2024-11-01 14:23:17 - DEBUG - Fetching: https://www.autotrader.co.za/...
2024-11-01 14:23:18 - INFO - [AutoTrader] Found 3 listing(s)
2024-11-01 14:23:19 - WARNING - [AutoTrader] Skipping malformed listing 2
```

**Log Levels:**
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for diagnosing problems
- **INFO**: Confirmation that things are working as expected
- **WARNING**: Something unexpected happened, but still working
- **ERROR**: A serious problem occurred

Change log level in `config.py`:
```python
LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"  # For verbose logging
LOG_LEVEL = "INFO"   # Default (recommended)
LOG_LEVEL = "ERROR"  # Only show errors
```

## Adding New Websites

1. Create a new scraper in `trackers/`
2. Follow the pattern from existing scrapers
3. Add to `SCRAPERS` list in `main.py`

Example:
```python
# trackers/newSiteTracker.py
from trackers.baseTracker import fetch_page, create_listing
from logger import logger
from config import NEW_SITE_BASE_URL

SOURCE = "NewSite"

def scrape_newsite(search_term):
    """Scrape NewSite for a specific search term"""
    url = f"{NEW_SITE_BASE_URL}/search?q={search_term}"
    
    logger.info(f"[{SOURCE}] Searching: {search_term}")
    
    soup = fetch_page(url)
    if not soup:
        return {}
    
    listings = {}
    # ... extract listings ...
    
    logger.info(f"[{SOURCE}] Found {len(listings)} listing(s)")
    return listings
```

Then in `main.py`:
```python
from trackers.newSiteTracker import scrape_newsite

SCRAPERS = [
    scrape_autotrader,
    scrape_gumtree,
    scrape_newsite  # Add here
]
```

And in `config.py`:
```python
NEW_SITE_BASE_URL = "https://newsite.com"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No listings found" for existing bikes

- Check the bike name format matches the website exactly
- Try different variations (e.g., "CB500X" vs "CB 500 X")
- Check if the bike exists on that website
- Look in `tracker.log` for detailed error messages

### 404 Errors

- Verify the bike model name is correct
- Some bikes may not be available on all sites
- Check the website URL structure hasn't changed
- View the actual URL in `tracker.log` (set `LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"`)

### Rate Limiting / Getting Blocked

If you're getting blocked:
- Increase sleep intervals in `config.py`:
  ```python
  SLEEP_MIN = 4
  SLEEP_MAX = 7
  ```
- Run less frequently
- Check website's `robots.txt`
- Review logs for HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors

### Script Crashes

- Check `tracker.log` for detailed error messages
- Enable DEBUG logging in `config.py`:
  ```python
  LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
  ```
- Look for patterns in which scraper is failing
- One scraper failure won't crash the entire script anymore

### Malformed Listings

The tracker now handles malformed listings gracefully:
- Skips listings with missing data
- Logs warnings for debugging
- Continues processing other listings
- Check `tracker.log` to see which listings were skipped

## Advanced Usage

### Running Periodically

**Linux/Mac (cron):**
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Run every day at 9 AM
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/motorcycle-tracker && python main.py

# Run every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/motorcycle-tracker && python main.py
```

**Windows (Task Scheduler):**
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger (daily, hourly, etc.)
4. Action: Start a program
5. Program: `python`
6. Arguments: `C:\path\to\motorcycle-tracker\main.py`
7. Start in: `C:\path\to\motorcycle-tracker`

### Monitoring Logs

**View recent activity:**
```bash
tail -f tracker.log
```

**Search for errors:**
```bash
grep ERROR tracker.log
```

**Count new listings found today:**
```bash
grep "NEW listing(s)" tracker.log | grep "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
```
